## Ansible Playbook for Server Configuration and Web Server Deployment using Multiple Roles

### Objective

This Ansible playbook aims to configure and manage three servers: two Ubuntu servers (one functioning as the host server and the other as a web server) and one CentOS server. The playbook is structured with a focus on role-based task grouping to enhance organization and management. The roles encompassed within the playbook are:

- **Script Runner Role**: Executes a bash script or custom commands on the servers as needed.

- **Apache Role**: Installs and configures Apache web server on the Ubuntu servers. Starts the Apache service and deploys web applications or static files.

- **Nginx Role**: Installs and configures Nginx web server on the CentOS server. Starts the Nginx service and deploys web applications or static files.

- **Terraform Role**: Installs Terraform on the host server and manages infrastructure deployments using Terraform.

- **Docker Role**: Installs Docker on all servers and manages containers and containerized applications.

### Playbook Execution

The playbook was executed as a unified playbook with the following structure for roles:

```yaml
- name: Server Configuration, Web Server Deployment, and Multiple Roles
  hosts: all
  roles:
    - script-runner
    - apache
    - nginx
    - terraform
    - docker
```

### Conclusion

Through the utilization of this Ansible playbook, the servers were efficiently configured and managed using distinct roles. The **script-runner** role successfully executed bash scripts or custom commands, while the **apache** role effectively installed and configured the Apache web server.

Similarly, the **nginx** role proficiently handled the installation and configuration of the Nginx web server.

Furthermore, the **terraform** and **docker** roles played vital roles in facilitating infrastructure management and containerization, respectively.

The collaborative implementation of these roles ensured streamlined server operations and comprehensive system administration.
